# KARINA — AI-Powered Mortgage Simulation on ICP

**ICP Hackathon Project | Web3 + Smart Mortgage Planning**

**KARINA** is a Web3-based mortgage (KPR) simulation application that leverages the power of **AI and the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain**. With an intuitive interface and Motoko-powered backend, this app allows users to **strategically plan their mortgage**, analyze interest rates, simulate early repayments, and integrate their schedule into calendars.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many people struggle to clearly plan their home financing — especially understanding the impact of early payments, floating interest, or penalties. Conventional mortgage calculators are often static, rigid, and non-transparent.

**KARINA offers a modern solution: decentralized, intelligent, and transparent.**
